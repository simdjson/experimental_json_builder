# Experimental JSON Builder based on reflection

This project seeks to develop a JSON builder library using the latest features of C++. 
That is, we see to build fast and convenient code to map your data structure to JSON strings.

Ultimately, this work might cover both serialization and deserialization.

We've seen different proposals forhttps://github.com/nlohmann/json?tab=readme-ov-file#simplify-your-life-with-macros C++ reflection, for now we will focus on the latest paper (https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2023/p2996r1.html#converting-a-struct-to-a-tuple) that is targeting C++26.

Some other references regarding other implementations of reflection in C++:
- https://github.com/matus-chochlik/mirror/blob/develop/example/mirror/print_struct.cpp (depends on llvm-reflection branch + mirror library)
- https://godbolt.org/z/eo3zrro4v (using boost/ext static reflection, latest version is not currently compiling)

## Why we are interested in (de)serializing using reflection?
If you take a look at one of the reference implementations of (de)serialization
using modern C++ (https://github.com/nlohmann/json), you will notice in the
examples that to deal with custom structs/classes, you need to use specify
those 2 methods:

```c++
using json = nlohmann::json;

namespace ns {
    void to_json(json& j, const person& p) {
        j = json{{"name", p.name}, {"address", p.address}, {"age", p.age}};
    }

    void from_json(const json& j, person& p) {
        j.at("name").get_to(p.name);
        j.at("address").get_to(p.address);
        j.at("age").get_to(p.age);
    }
} // namespace ns
```

Or use one of the Macros described
[here](https://github.com/nlohmann/json?tab=readme-ov-file#simplify-your-life-with-macros) in your class/struct.

By leveraging reflection, we can support for something as simple as:

```c++
int main() {
    X s1 = {.a = '1', .b = 10, .c = 0, .d = "test string\n\r\"", .e = {1, 2, 3}, .f = {"ab", "cd", "fg"}};

    std::cout << to_json_string(s1) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

With ~200 lines of code (as you can see in the [toy_builder.cpp](prototype_playground/toy_builder.cpp)).

## Current status
There are 2 versions of compiler that aim to support the C++ 26 reflection paper.

1. [Clang-p2996 llvm branch](https://github.com/bloomberg/clang-p2996/tree/p2996) that open-source and available in the [Compiler Explorer](https://godbolt.org/z/eoEej3E6j).
2. EDG reflection branch that is only publicly available in the [Compiler Explorer](https://godbolt.org).

For now, we will resort to #1, since it is open-source. A docker container is available with this particular branch (thanks to Daniel Lemire) at [docker_programming_station repo](https://github.com/lemire/docker_programming_station/tree/master/clangp2996).

We are excited to hear that this reflection proposal seems to be on-track for C++26. [As per Herb Sutter](https://herbsutter.com/2024/03/22/trip-report-winter-iso-c-standards-meeting-tokyo-japan/).

## Instructions for running the toy_builder example locally (using docker)

We are assuming that you are running Linux or macOS. We recommend that Windows users rely on WSL.

Follow the following two steps:

1. Make sure that you have [docker installed and running](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) on your system. Most Linux distributions support docker though some (like RedHat) have the equivalent (Podman). Users of Apple systems may want to [consider OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev). You do not need to familiar with docker, you just need to make sure that you are have it running.
2. Make sure that docker containers have lots of RAM (e.g., 64 GB). If the build process fails, try to increase the amount of available RAM.
3. Navigate to our repository `experimental_json_builder` and run `./run_docker.sh bash`, this will enter a bash shell with access to the repo directory. Note that this will take some time when running it for the first time, since the specific container image has to be built. 


Now you should be able to run the following commands (on the `experimental_json_builder/src`):

1. Firstly, configure the build system with cmake:
```bash
cmake -B build
````
This only needs to be done once.

2. Build the code...
```bash
cmake --build build
```

3. Run the executable.
```bash
./build/src/ExperimentalJsonBuilder 
```


4. Run the benchmark.
```bash
./build/benchmarks/src/SerializationBenchmark
```

You can modify the source code with your favorite editor and run again steps 2 (Build the code) and 3 (Run the executable) and 4 (Run the benchmark).


## Profiling

You can profile the benchmark like so:

```
cmake --build build &&  perf record ./build/benchmarks/src/SerializationBenchmark && perf report
```

In perf is not available, you can install it like so:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install linux-perf
```

Your password inside the docker container is your username.
